Talent and outcome follows a power law. The difference between average and best is not 20%, it's 5000%. And truly gifted people are rare.

So, when you find one, do three things:

1. Partner with them, hire them, or whatever you have to do.
2. Get out of their way.
3. Never let them quit.

How do you know whether a person is a truly gitted person? Ask yourself:

1. Would I call this person if I was stuck in a third-world jail cell? ([George Mack](https://press.stripe.com/poor-charlies-almanack))
2. How stupid do I feel talking to this person? ([Giuliano](https://x.com/Giuliano_Mana/status/1880631676424085863))
3. Which of my people, if they told me they were quitting, would I fight hard to keep? (Netflix mantra)
